# PyTorch_Object_Localization

This project implements an object localization system using PyTorch. It trains a custom deep learning model to predict bounding boxes on images of vegetables such as mushrooms, eggplants, and cucumbers. The system uses EfficientNet as a backbone and is trained with annotated bounding box coordinates.
